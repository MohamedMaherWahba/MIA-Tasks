# **Software Practical Low-Pass Filter (LPF) Design Documentation for WALL-E's Encoder Signal**

---

## **Requirements:**

To design the LPF, the following information is required:

1. Maximum speed of WALL-E.
2. Encoder specifications, specifically the number of pulses per revolution.

## **Calculation Steps:**

### **Step 1: Calculate the maximum angular velocity of the motorized wheel**

1. Determine the diameter of the motorized wheel.
2. Calculate the circumference of the wheel using the formula C = π * d, where d is the diameter.
3. Convert the maximum linear velocity of WALL-E to cm/s (if necessary).
4. Calculate the maximum angular velocity using the formula ω = v / r, where v is the linear velocity and r is the radius of the wheel.

### **Step 2: Calculate the maximum frequency of pulses from the encoder**

1. Obtain the number of pulses per revolution from the encoder specifications.
2. Calculate the maximum frequency of pulses using the formula f = ω / (2π), where ω is the angular velocity.

### **Step 3: Determine the cutoff frequency for the LPF**

1. Choose a cutoff frequency that is below the maximum frequency of pulses to effectively filter out noise and high-frequency variations.
2. It is generally recommended to select a cutoff frequency that is around 10% - 20% of the maximum frequency.

## **Example Calculation:**

let's go through an example calculation using the given values:

1. Maximum linear velocity: 0.5 m/s
2. Wheel diameter: 40 cm
3. Pulses per revolution: 540

Step 1: Calculate the maximum angular velocity of the motorized wheel

- Wheel circumference: C = π * 40 = 125.66 cm
- Linear velocity in cm/s: 0.5 * 100 = 50 cm/s
- Radius of the wheel: 20 cm
- Maximum angular velocity: ω = 50 / 20 = 2.5 rad/s

Step 2: Calculate the maximum frequency of pulses from the encoder

- Maximum frequency of pulses: f = 2.5 / (2π) = 0.3977 Hz

Step 3: Determine the cutoff frequency for the LPF

- • Choose a cutoff frequency of 0.04 Hz (10% of the maximum frequency)

The proper cutoff frequency (fc) for the software practical low-pass filter for WALL-E's encoder signal is calculated to be 0.04 Hz.
